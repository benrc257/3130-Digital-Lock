# Digital Pin Lock

This project was completed for Professor Tarek Elfouly in ECE 3130 - Microcomputer Systems. The goal was to create a digital pin lock using a microcontroller.

## Description

Using a STML476RG microcontroller and accompanying externals, we designed a comprehensive digital pin lock system using C. The device can be used as a pin lock with multiple possible codes that can each be separately removed or added.
